This app was made in a group of 4 for the class COMS 309 at Iowa State University. 

# SPINDER
Spinder is an app where you can go to discover music. This app allows users to connect their account to their Spotify account.
Once in the app the user can then type in the name of a song they want their reccomendations to be based on. Then, they will be able to swipe through a multitude of songs that our algorithm recommends based on the song they typed in.
The user can then swipe up to add a song to a playlist we create on Spotify. The user can also interact with their profile, where they can see their all-time top song and artist. They can also chat with friends and see their friends accounts.
